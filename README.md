# 🧪 AI Clinical Trials Architect  
### Autonomous Multi-Agent RAG System for Protocol Design, Evaluation & Feasibility Analysis  


The **AI Clinical Trials Architect** is a next-generation, autonomous **RAG-powered** system designed to draft, evaluate, and optimize clinical trial protocols.

It combines:

- 🤖 Multi-agent LLM reasoning  
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- 🏛️ FDA & Ethics guideline validation  
- 🧬 Real patient feasibility using the MIMIC-III dataset  
- 🧠 Autonomous self-improvement loop  
- 🖥️ A clean, professional Streamlit interface

## **Autonomous Multi-Agent Architecture**

### Agents:
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Planner | Breaks query into tasks |
| Researcher | PubMed RAG |
| Regulatory Specialist | FDA RAG |
| Ethics Specialist | Ethics RAG |
| SQL Coder | MIMIC SQL query generation |
| Cohort Analyst | Real-world feasibility |

# 🌟 Project Summary

The **AI Clinical Trials Architect** is an end-to-end system that:

- Designs clinical trial protocols  
- Retrieves scientific + regulatory + ethical evidence  
- Evaluates protocol quality  
- Checks feasibility via patient-level SQL queries  
- Improves itself automatically  

This system behaves like a **virtual junior clinical research scientist** — minus coffee breaks, mood swings, and meetings that should've been emails.

# 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Clinical trial design traditionally requires:

- Literature review  
- Regulatory compliance checks  
- Ethical validation  
- Patient feasibility analysis  
- Protocol drafting  
- Endless revisions  

➡️ **This system automates 70–80% of that workflow.**  

The result:  
⏳ Faster timelines  
🧬 Evidence-backed designs  
🧠 Fewer human errors  
🛡️ Higher regulatory confidence

# 🧠 What Is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**  
A simple, powerful cycle:


RAG ensures the AI does not hallucinate medical nonsense like:

> “Dose the patient with 500mg of oxygen.”  
(Yes, models without RAG really say stuff like this.)

# 🤖 What Is Autonomous RAG?

If RAG is a “student who reads before answering,”  
**Autonomous RAG is a student who reads, answers, grades their work, fixes mistakes, and improves every iteration.**

It adds:

- Multi-agent reasoning  
- Evaluation engine  
- Diagnostician  
- SOP-evolution agent
